                                    <h4 align="center"><strong>Chapter 10. Risks.</strong></h4>
                                    <p align="justify"><strong>10.1. </strong>Buyer has enough knowledge and experience in financial matters, as well as in blockchain technology and crypto token transactions.</p>
                                    <p align="justify"><strong>10.2. </strong>Buyer acknowledges, understands and assume the following risks related with the purchase of Gemeras, as well as all the other risks not included herein:</p>
                                    <ol type="a">
                                        <li>Gemeras are supported by Ethereum blockchain, and use a standard ERC 20 smart contract. Buyer must be aware of the functioning of this technology and the associated risks.</li>
                                        <li>Because Gemeras are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on Gemeras. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to Gemeras, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.</li>
                                        <li>As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, Gemeras are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Gemeras transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to Gemeras, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Gemeras.</li>
                                        <li>In case Ethereum network presents failures, malfunction or critical vulnerabilities, and whether Company considers it totally necessary, a transition will be made to another blockchain platform that meets the requirements for the optimal continuation of the project, and a process for such migration will be designed.</li>
                                        <li>Hacking attack. Hacking or any other malicious activities may affect Gemera distribution or may cause the loss of Buyer’s Gemeras. In such event, Gemeras may not be recovered. Company shall not be liable in any case for any losses caused by an attack. Company would however do its best effort to find a possible solution. Hackers may attempt to interfere with Gemeras in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing, and spoofing. Furthermore, because the project is based on open-source software, there is a risk that a third party may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses into the core infrastructure of the project, which could negatively affect the project and Gemeras.</li>
                                        <li>Market associated risks. Company will not facilitate any secondary trading or external valuation of Gemeras. This could therefore create illiquidity risk with respect to Gemeras Buyer holds. Even if secondary trading of Gemeras is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Gemeras (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</li>
                                        <li>Private Keys. Gemeras will be allocated in the buyer’s compatible digital wallet, for which a private key is required. The protection of the private key is sole responsibility of the Buyer; the loss of the private key will cause the Buyer not to be capable of having access to the Gemeras or make any transactions with them. Company does not have the capacity to recover the private keys, as so it does not have access to them.</li>
                                        <li>Loss of private keys. In case the Buyer loses the private keys to access the digital wallet, Company will not have the capacity to recover them; therefore it will not be possible for Buyer to use the Gemeras in any case, including transaction or redemption.</li>
                                        <li>Wallet compatibility. There are many incompatible wallets for the purchase of Gemeras. Buyer is aware of the compatible and incompatible wallets. Whether buyer uses incompatible wallets, the Gemeras purchased may disappear (for more information about wallet compatibility, please read the Company’s <a href="faq.html" target="_blank">FAQs</a>).</li>
                                        <li>Compatible wallets. Company is not responsible whether the compatible wallets for the purchase of Gemeras suffer any vulnerability.</li>
                                        <li>In the Ethereum Main Network there may be ERC20 tokens or others with the same ticker symbol as Gemera (GEMA), but do not represent the Company neither its tokens. The official Gemera token address is <strong>0xe9a2090557e9666676168cde58c8e18c5a03b2b7</strong> and the Gemera smart contract address for distribution is <strong>0x3159d7777a38d092b1cb1ef74cce63fd0dd67b97</strong> User secures that the Gemeras acquired are linked to these contracts.</li>
                                        <li>The Ethers (ETH) to purchase Gemeras cannot be sent through exchanges or multisignature wallets. </li>
                                        <li>To purchase Gemeras, Buyer cannot send any crypto token different from Ether (ETH) to the token distribution  ETH address  specified in <a href="index.html">www.gemera.io</a> This will cause the loss of those crypto tokens.</li>
                                        <li>Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions. The regulatory status of Gemeras and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including Gemeras. Regulatory actions could negatively impact Gemeras in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Gemeras are a regulated financial instrument that require registration or licensing. Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.</li>
                                        <li>Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance. The project is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although Company will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, Company may have to make changes to the specifications of Gemeras for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that Gemeras, as further developed and maintained, may not meet Buyer`s expectations at the time of purchasing Gemeras. Furthermore, despite Company`s good faith efforts to develop and maintain the project, it is still possible that the project will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact the potential utility of Gemeras.</li>
                                        <li>Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether. Company intends to use the proceeds from Gemeras distribution to fund the maintenance and development of the project. The proceeds of the distribution of Gemeras will be denominated in Ether, and may, at Company’s discretion, be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the token distribution’s period, Company may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain the project in the manner that it intended.</li>
                                        <li>Unanticipated Risks. Cryptographic tokens such as Gemeras are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks above, there are other risks associated with the purchase, holding, and use of Gemeras, including those that Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks mentioned above.</li>
